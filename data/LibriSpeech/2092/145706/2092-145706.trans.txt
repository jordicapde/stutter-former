2092-145706-0000 KLETKE THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD THREE FINE LOOKING SONS BUT THEY WERE SO POOR THAT THEY HAD HARDLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR THEMSELVES LET ALONE THEIR CHILDREN
2092-145706-0001 OF HER AND THEIR FATHER THE THREE SET FORTH ON THEIR TRAVELS THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS WHOSE NAME WAS FERKO WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WITH A SPLENDID FIGURE BLUE EYES FAIR HAIR
2092-145706-0002 AND A COMPLEXION LIKE MILK AND ROSES HIS TWO BROTHERS WERE AS JEALOUS OF HIM AS THEY COULD BE FOR THEY THOUGHT THAT WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS HE WOULD BE SURE TO BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN THEY WOULD EVER BE
2092-145706-0003 FOR THE SUN WAS HOT AND THEY WERE TIRED OF WALKING FERKO FELL FAST ASLEEP BUT THE OTHER TWO REMAINED AWAKE AND THE ELDEST SAID TO THE SECOND BROTHER WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DOING OUR BROTHER FERKO SOME HARM
2092-145706-0004 HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVERYONE TAKES A FANCY TO HIM WHICH IS MORE THAN THEY DO TO US IF WE COULD ONLY GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WE MIGHT SUCCEED BETTER I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU ANSWERED THE SECOND BROTHER
2092-145706-0005 AND MY ADVICE IS TO EAT UP HIS LOAF OF BREAD AND THEN TO REFUSE TO GIVE HIM A BIT OF OURS UNTIL HE HAS PROMISED TO LET US PUT OUT HIS EYES OR BREAK HIS LEGS HIS ELDEST BROTHER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL
2092-145706-0006 AND THE TWO WICKED WRETCHES SEIZED FERKO'S LOAF AND ATE IT ALL UP WHILE THE POOR BOY WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN HE DID AWAKE HE FELT VERY HUNGRY AND TURNED TO EAT HIS BREAD BUT HIS BROTHERS CRIED OUT
2092-145706-0007 YOU ATE YOUR LOAF IN YOUR SLEEP YOU GLUTTON AND YOU MAY STARVE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T GET A SCRAP OF OURS FERKO WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE EATEN IN HIS SLEEP BUT HE SAID NOTHING
2092-145706-0008 AND FASTED ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT NIGHT BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE BURST INTO TEARS AND IMPLORED HIS BROTHERS TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR BREAD
2092-145706-0009 AND BREAK ONE OF YOUR LEGS THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF OUR BREAD AT THESE WORDS POOR FERKO WEPT MORE BITTERLY THAN BEFORE AND BORE THE TORMENTS OF HUNGER TILL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
2092-145706-0010 THEN HE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND HE CONSENTED TO ALLOW HIS LEFT EYE TO BE PUT OUT AND HIS LEFT LEG TO BE BROKEN WHEN THIS WAS DONE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND EAGERLY FOR THE PIECE OF BREAD
2092-145706-0011 BUT HIS BROTHERS GAVE HIM SUCH A TINY SCRAP THAT THE STARVING YOUTH FINISHED IT IN A MOMENT AND BESOUGHT THEM FOR A SECOND BIT BUT THE MORE FERKO WEPT AND TOLD HIS BROTHERS THAT HE WAS DYING OF HUNGER
2092-145706-0012 THE MORE THEY LAUGHED AND SCOLDED HIM FOR HIS GREED SO HE ENDURED THE PANGS OF STARVATION ALL THAT DAY BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME HIS ENDURANCE GAVE WAY AND HE LET HIS RIGHT EYE BE PUT OUT
2092-145706-0013 AND HIS RIGHT LEG BROKEN FOR A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AFTER HIS BROTHERS HAD THUS SUCCESSFULLY MAIMED AND DISFIGURED HIM FOR LIFE THEY LEFT HIM GROANING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT HIM
2092-145706-0014 POOR FERKO ATE UP THE SCRAP OF BREAD THEY HAD LEFT HIM AND WEPT BITTERLY BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM OR CAME TO HIS HELP NIGHT CAME ON AND THE POOR BLIND YOUTH HAD NO EYES TO CLOSE
2092-145706-0015 AND COULD ONLY CRAWL ALONG THE GROUND NOT KNOWING IN THE LEAST WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS ONCE MORE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS FERKO FELT THE BLAZING HEAT SCORCH HIM
2092-145706-0016 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME COOL SHADY PLACE TO REST HIS ACHING LIMBS HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A HILL AND LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS AND AS HE THOUGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF A BIG TREE
2092-145706-0017 IS THERE ANYTHING THE LEAST WONDERFUL OR REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I SHOULD JUST THINK THERE WAS REPLIED THE OTHER MANY THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
2092-145706-0018 THERE IS A LAKE DOWN THERE BELOW US AND ANYONE WHO BATHES IN IT THOUGH HE WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECOMES SOUND AND WELL ON THE SPOT AND THOSE WHO WASH THEIR EYES WITH THE DEW ON THIS HILL
2092-145706-0019 BECOME AS SHARP SIGHTED AS THE EAGLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN BLIND FROM THEIR YOUTH WELL ANSWERED THE FIRST RAVEN MY EYES ARE IN NO WANT OF THIS HEALING BATH FOR HEAVEN BE PRAISED
2092-145706-0020 THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THEY WERE BUT MY WING HAS BEEN VERY FEEBLE AND WEAK EVER SINCE IT WAS SHOT BY AN ARROW MANY YEARS AGO SO LET US FLY AT ONCE TO THE LAKE THAT I MAY BE RESTORED TO HEALTH AND STRENGTH AGAIN
2092-145706-0021 AND SO THEY FLEW AWAY THEIR WORDS REJOICED FERKO'S HEART AND HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY TILL EVENING SHOULD COME AND HE COULD RUB THE PRECIOUS DEW ON HIS SIGHTLESS EYES
2092-145706-0022 AT LAST IT BEGAN TO GROW DUSK AND THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS GRADUALLY IT BECAME COOLER ON THE HILL AND THE GRASS GREW WET WITH DEW THEN FERKO BURIED HIS FACE IN THE GROUND
2092-145706-0023 TILL HIS EYES WERE DAMP WITH DEWDROPS AND IN A MOMENT HE SAW CLEARER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND LIGHTED HIM TO THE LAKE WHERE HE COULD BATHE HIS POOR BROKEN LEGS
2092-145706-0024 THEN FERKO CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE AND DIPPED HIS LIMBS IN THE WATER NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO
2092-145706-0025 HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE MET A WOLF WHO WAS LIMPING DISCONSOLATELY ALONG ON THREE LEGS AND WHO ON PERCEIVING FERKO BEGAN TO HOWL DISMALLY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE YOUTH
2092-145706-0026 BE OF GOOD CHEER FOR I CAN SOON HEAL YOUR LEG AND WITH THESE WORDS HE POURED SOME OF THE PRECIOUS WATER OVER THE WOLF'S PAW AND IN A MINUTE THE ANIMAL WAS SPRINGING ABOUT SOUND AND WELL ON ALL FOURS
2092-145706-0027 THE GRATEFUL CREATURE THANKED HIS BENEFACTOR WARMLY AND PROMISED FERKO TO DO HIM A GOOD TURN IF HE SHOULD EVER NEED IT FERKO CONTINUED HIS WAY TILL HE CAME TO A PLOUGHED FIELD
2092-145706-0028 HERE HE NOTICED A LITTLE MOUSE CREEPING WEARILY ALONG ON ITS HIND PAWS FOR ITS FRONT PAWS HAD BOTH BEEN BROKEN IN A TRAP FERKO FELT SO SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BEAST
2092-145706-0029 THAT HE SPOKE TO IT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER AND WASHED ITS SMALL PAWS WITH THE HEALING WATER IN A MOMENT THE MOUSE WAS SOUND AND WHOLE AND AFTER THANKING THE KIND PHYSICIAN IT SCAMPERED AWAY OVER THE PLOUGHED FURROWS
2092-145706-0030 FERKO AGAIN PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HADN'T GONE FAR BEFORE A QUEEN BEE FLEW AGAINST HIM TRAILING ONE WING BEHIND HER WHICH HAD BEEN CRUELLY TORN IN TWO BY A BIG BIRD
2092-145706-0031 FERKO WAS NO LESS WILLING TO HELP HER THAN HE HAD BEEN TO HELP THE WOLF AND THE MOUSE SO HE POURED SOME HEALING DROPS OVER THE WOUNDED WING ON THE SPOT THE QUEEN BEE WAS CURED AND TURNING TO FERKO SHE SAID
2092-145706-0032 I AM MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND SHALL REWARD YOU SOME DAY AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE FLEW AWAY HUMMING GAILY THEN FERKO WANDERED ON FOR MANY A LONG DAY
2092-145706-0033 AND AT LENGTH REACHED A STRANGE KINGDOM HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HE MIGHT AS WELL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND OFFER HIS SERVICES TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER
2092-145706-0034 THEY HAD MANAGED TO OBTAIN PLACES IN THE KING'S SERVICE AND WHEN THEY RECOGNISED FERKO WITH HIS EYES AND LEGS SOUND AND WELL THEY WERE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH FOR THEY FEARED HE WOULD TELL THE KING OF THEIR CONDUCT
2092-145706-0035 FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO HANDSOME IN HER LIFE BEFORE HIS BROTHERS NOTICED THIS AND ENVY AND JEALOUSY WERE ADDED TO THEIR FEAR SO MUCH SO THAT THEY DETERMINED ONCE MORE TO DESTROY HIM
2092-145706-0036 THEY WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT FERKO WAS A WICKED MAGICIAN WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE WITH THE INTENTION OF CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS THEN THE KING HAD FERKO BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SAID
2092-145706-0037 YOU ARE ACCUSED OF BEING A MAGICIAN WHO WISHES TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER AND I CONDEMN YOU TO DEATH BUT IF YOU CAN FULFIL THREE TASKS WHICH I SHALL SET YOU TO DO YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED
2092-145706-0038 ON CONDITION YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT IF YOU CANNOT PERFORM WHAT I DEMAND YOU SHALL BE HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE AND TURNING TO THE TWO WICKED BROTHERS HE SAID SUGGEST SOMETHING FOR HIM TO DO
2092-145706-0039 NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT HE MUST SUCCEED IN IT OR DIE THEY DID NOT THINK LONG BUT REPLIED LET HIM BUILD YOUR MAJESTY IN ONE DAY A MORE BEAUTIFUL PALACE THAN THIS AND IF HE FAILS IN THE ATTEMPT
2092-145706-0040 LET HIM BE HUNG THE KING WAS PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND COMMANDED FERKO TO SET TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TWO BROTHERS WERE DELIGHTED FOR THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NOW GOT RID OF FERKO FOR EVER
2092-145706-0041 AS HE WAS WANDERING DISCONSOLATELY ABOUT THE MEADOWS ROUND THE PALACE WONDERING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE BEING PUT TO DEATH A LITTLE BEE FLEW PAST AND SETTLING ON HIS SHOULDER WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
2092-145706-0042 WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU MY KIND BENEFACTOR CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU I AM THE BEE WHOSE WING YOU HEALED
2092-145706-0043 A PALACE SHALL BE BUILT UNLIKE ANY THAT KING HAS DWELT IN BEFORE JUST STAY HERE TILL I COME AGAIN AND TELL YOU THAT IT IS FINISHED HAVING SAID THIS SHE FLEW MERRILY AWAY AND FERKO
2092-145706-0044 BE OF GOOD CHEER AND LEAD THE KING TO THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS AND HUMMING GAILY SHE FLEW AWAY AGAIN FERKO WENT AT ONCE TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THE PALACE WAS FINISHED
2092-145706-0045 THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER AND THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS GREAT AT THE SIGHT WHICH MET THEIR EYES A SPLENDID PALACE REARED ITSELF ON THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY MADE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE FLOWERS
2092-145706-0046 WITH SUNFLOWERS FOR KNOCKERS AND ALL ROUND HYACINTHS AND OTHER SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS BLOOMED IN MASSES SO THAT THE AIR WAS PERFUMED FAR AND NEAR AND ENCHANTED ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
2092-145706-0047 THIS SPLENDID PALACE HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE GRATEFUL QUEEN BEE WHO HAD SUMMONED ALL THE OTHER BEES IN THE KINGDOM TO HELP HER THE KING'S AMAZEMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND THE PRINCESS'S EYES BEAMED WITH DELIGHT
2092-145706-0048 ON THE DELIGHTED FERKO BUT THE TWO BROTHERS HAD GROWN QUITE GREEN WITH ENVY AND ONLY DECLARED THE MORE THAT FERKO WAS NOTHING BUT A WICKED MAGICIAN
2092-145706-0049 THE KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT THE WAY HIS COMMANDS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WAS VERY VEXED
2092-145706-0050 AND TURNING TO THE TWO BROTHERS HE SAID HE HAS CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED THE FIRST TASK WITH THE AID NO DOUBT OF HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC BUT WHAT SHALL WE GIVE HIM TO DO NOW
2092-145706-0051 LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
2092-145706-0052 LET THE KNAVE COLLECT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM INTO ONE BIG HEAP BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS LEFT LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH
2092-145706-0053 THE PRINCESS GREW WHITE WITH TERROR WHEN SHE HEARD THESE WORDS BUT FERKO FELT MUCH MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAD DONE THE FIRST TIME AND WANDERED OUT INTO THE MEADOWS AGAIN
2092-145706-0054 BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF ESCAPE THE SUN SANK TO REST AND NIGHT CAME ON WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE STARTED OUT OF THE GRASS AT FERKO'S FEET AND SAID TO HIM I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
2092-145706-0055 MY KIND BENEFACTOR BUT WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO SAD CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU AND THUS REPAY YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME THEN FERKO RECOGNISED THE MOUSE WHOSE FRONT PAWS HE HAD HEALED AND REPLIED
2092-145706-0056 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM HAS TO BE GATHERED INTO ONE BIG HEAP AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS WANTING I MUST PAY FOR IT WITH MY LIFE IS THAT ALL ANSWERED THE MOUSE
2092-145706-0057 THAT NEEDN'T DISTRESS YOU MUCH JUST TRUST IN ME AND BEFORE THE SUN SETS AGAIN YOU SHALL HEAR THAT YOUR TASK IS DONE AND WITH THESE WORDS THE LITTLE CREATURE SCAMPERED AWAY INTO THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0058 FERKO WHO NEVER DOUBTED THAT THE MOUSE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ITS WORD LAY DOWN COMFORTED ON THE SOFT GRASS AND SLEPT SOUNDLY TILL NEXT MORNING THE DAY PASSED SLOWLY
2092-145706-0059 AND THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER
2092-145706-0060 FOR IN A HEAP HIGHER THAN THE KING'S PALACE LAY ALL THE GRAIN OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT A SINGLE STALK OF CORN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN ANY OF THE FIELDS AND HOW HAD ALL THIS BEEN DONE
2092-145706-0061 THE LITTLE MOUSE HAD SUMMONED EVERY OTHER MOUSE IN THE LAND TO ITS HELP AND TOGETHER THEY HAD COLLECTED ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM THE KING COULD NOT HIDE HIS AMAZEMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME HIS WRATH INCREASED
2092-145706-0062 AND HE WAS MORE READY THAN EVER TO BELIEVE THE TWO BROTHERS WHO KEPT ON REPEATING
2092-145706-0063 THAN A WICKED MAGICIAN ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS REJOICED OVER FERKO'S SUCCESS AND LOOKED ON HIM WITH FRIENDLY GLANCES WHICH THE YOUTH RETURNED THE MORE THE CRUEL KING GAZED ON THE WONDER BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0064 THE MORE ANGRY HE BECAME FOR HE COULD NOT IN THE FACE OF HIS PROMISE PUT THE STRANGER TO DEATH HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC HAS HELPED HIM AGAIN
2092-145706-0065 BUT NOW WHAT THIRD TASK SHALL WE SET HIM TO DO NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS HE MUST DO IT OR DIE THE ELDEST ANSWERED QUICKLY LET HIM DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THIS HILL
2092-145706-0066 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT IF HE DOES THIS HE MAY GO FREE IF NOT HE SHALL BE HUNG AS YOU HAVE SAID AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCESS BURST INTO TEARS
2092-145706-0067 AND WHEN THE KING SAW THIS HE ORDERED HER TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER AND CAREFULLY GUARDED TILL THE DANGEROUS MAGICIAN SHOULD EITHER HAVE LEFT THE KINGDOM OR BEEN HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE FERKO WANDERED OUT INTO THE FIELDS AGAIN
2092-145706-0068 AND SAT DOWN ON THE STUMP OF A TREE WONDERING WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT SUDDENLY A BIG WOLF RAN UP TO HIM AND STANDING STILL SAID I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MY KIND BENEFACTOR
2092-145706-0069 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ALL ALONE BY YOURSELF IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY ONLY SAY THE WORD FOR I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PROOF OF MY GRATITUDE FERKO AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE WOLF
2092-145706-0070 WHOSE BROKEN LEG HE HAD HEALED AND TOLD HIM WHAT HE HAD TO DO THE FOLLOWING DAY IF HE WISHED TO ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE BUT HOW IN THE WORLD HE ADDED AM I TO COLLECT ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THAT HILL OVER THERE
2092-145706-0071 IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT DONE ANSWERED THE WOLF YOU NEEDN'T WORRY YOURSELF I'LL UNDERTAKE THE TASK AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN BEFORE SUNSET TO MORROW
2092-145706-0072 AND WITH THESE WORDS HE TROTTED QUICKLY AWAY THEN THE YOUTH REJOICED GREATLY FOR NOW HE FELT THAT HIS LIFE WAS SAFE BUT HE GREW VERY SAD WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
2092-145706-0073 AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0074 THEN RETURN AT ONCE TO ME AND GET ON MY BACK AND I WILL HELP YOU TO DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES TOGETHER THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND TOLD THE KING THAT HE WAS READY TO PERFORM THE THIRD TASK IF HE WOULD COME TO THE HILL AND SEE IT DONE
2092-145706-0075 FERKO HIMSELF RETURNED TO THE FIELDS AND MOUNTING ON THE WOLF'S BACK HE RODE TO THE WOOD CLOSE BY QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE WOLF FLEW ROUND THE WOOD AND IN A MINUTE MANY HUNDRED WOLVES ROSE UP BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0076 INCREASING IN NUMBER EVERY MOMENT TILL THEY COULD BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS HE DROVE THEM ALL BEFORE HIM ON TO THE HILL WHERE THE KING AND HIS WHOLE COURT AND FERKO'S TWO BROTHERS WERE STANDING ONLY THE LOVELY PRINCESS WAS NOT PRESENT
2092-145706-0077 FOR SHE WAS SHUT UP IN HER TOWER WEEPING BITTERLY THE WICKED BROTHERS STAMPED AND FOAMED WITH RAGE WHEN THEY SAW THE FAILURE OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THE KING WAS OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN TERROR
2092-145706-0078 WHEN HE SAW THE ENORMOUS PACK OF WOLVES APPROACHING NEARER AND NEARER AND CALLING OUT TO FERKO HE SAID ENOUGH ENOUGH WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BUT THE WOLF ON WHOSE BACK FERKO SAT SAID TO ITS RIDER
2092-145706-0079 GO ON GO ON AND AT THE SAME MOMENT MANY MORE WOLVES RAN UP THE HILL HOWLING HORRIBLY AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE TEETH THE KING IN HIS TERROR CALLED OUT STOP A MOMENT I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM
2092-145706-0080 IF YOU WILL DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES AWAY BUT FERKO PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR AND DROVE SOME MORE THOUSANDS BEFORE HIM SO THAT EVERYONE QUAKED WITH HORROR AND FEAR THEN THE KING RAISED HIS VOICE AGAIN AND CALLED OUT
2092-145706-0081 STOP YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHOLE KINGDOM IF YOU WILL ONLY DRIVE THESE WOLVES BACK TO THE PLACES THEY CAME FROM BUT THE WOLF KEPT ON ENCOURAGING FERKO AND SAID GO ON GO ON SO HE LED THE WOLVES ON
2092-145706-0082 TILL AT LAST THEY FELL ON THE KING AND ON THE WICKED BROTHERS AND ATE THEM AND THE WHOLE COURT UP IN A MOMENT THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND SET THE PRINCESS FREE AND ON THE SAME DAY
2092-145706-0083 HE MARRIED HER AND WAS CROWNED KING OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WOLVES ALL WENT PEACEFULLY BACK TO THEIR OWN HOMES AND FERKO AND HIS BRIDE LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS TOGETHER
